            <p>The Brainster microlearning app is designed to offer users short, bite-sized information in the format of
                case studies, with which they can upgrade their skills in their day-to-day lives. The goal of this app
                is to offer lessons that last from five to 15 minutes that users can read while commuting to work or
                school, during their break, and pretty much anywhere and anytime they choose.
                <br>
                <br>
                The <strong> biggest challenge </strong>of this project is to help users acquire a new skill or upgrade
                an
                already existing one in a way that will take up very little time in their daily lives, but at the same
                time, motivate them to be consistent and not give up in the middle of the process.

                <p>
                    The <strong>main goal </strong> for this project is to simplify the whole process of finding
                    suitable
                    candidates, and create a site where learning partners can specify what kind of people they need for
                    a
                    certain position without having to schedule meetings beforehand. The concept of the site was to
                    include
                    some of Brainster’s alumni on the website in order to give the learning partners a general idea of
                    the
                    students and their qualities. The idea is for the learning partners to take a look at some of the
                    candidates and then schedule a meeting with the Brainster team in order to get recommendations that
                    will
                    be tailored to the company’s needs.

                    <h2 class="user-research"> User research:</h2>
                    The first step I took when I started working on this project was user research. I surveyed 35
                    people,
                    out of whom 60% of them are currently using some type of a learning app. The main goal of the
                    majority
                    of the respondents (62.86%) is to gain a new skill or upgrade an already existing skill. Other goals
                    include helping with schoolwork, getting a better job, and some people use these apps just for fun.
                    </p>
                    <img class="survey" src="img/survey.png" alt="">
                    <p>The
                        most popular apps among the surveyed users are Udemy, Coursera, and Duolingo. When it comes to
                        the
                        users’ motivation when completing a course, I noticed that 28.6% of the respondents finish all
                        the
                        courses they take up, while 40% of the remaining respondents finish most of the courses they
                        take
                        up.
                        This number is not bad by itself, but the data I have gathered can help increase the numbers
                        even
                        further. When asked about the things they like the most about the online apps they use, the main
                        response was that they like apps that are easy to use, while they dislike many notifications and
                        reminders, ads, bad UI, and long courses. </p>

                        <strong>User persona: </strong> <br>
                        According to my research, I realised that the main target group are users between 18 and 45
                        years
                        who want to use an online app that can help them acquire knowledge in a fast and easy way. That
                        is
                        why I created a user persona that really helped me during the design process.

                    <p class="accessibility">
                        <strong>Solving the accessibility problem: </strong> <br>
                        One thing that I have noticed about the apps I was researching, I realised that the apps are not
                        very accessible for different profiles of users. Given that the microlearning app is based on
                        reading case studies, it is very important to make it easy to use for people with dyslexia or
                        visual
                        impairment. I consulted a defectologist on the matter, and from the advice I gathered, I decided
                        to include two new features: change the font type and size of the
                        text,
                        and listen to the case study. The first feature includes a font called OpenDyslexia3, a font
                        created
                        for dyslexic people.
                    </p>

                    <p class="game">
                        <strong>Gamification suggestion: </strong> <br>
                        In order to motivate users to open new lessons everyday, users will receive medals for every
                        lesson
                        they complete. For the second phase of the project, after collecting a big number of medals,
                        users
                        will get certain badges (Ex. UX Rookie, UX Professional, UX Wizard etc.), and after winning the
                        final badge, the user will earn a certificate. Another factor that will also motivate users is
                        the
                        fact that they can open the current lesson in the timeslot of 24 hours, and after that it will
                        not
                        be available until the whole course is done. This will motivate users by triggering their "fear
                        of
                        missing out". The users will also be able to see their progress in the courses they are
                        learning,
                        which can also help and increase motivation.

                        <strong>User interface: </strong> <br>
                        When it comes to the UI, I decided to use complementary colours because they have the biggest
                        contrast.
                        I chose blue as the primary colour because, according to colour psychology, it is associated
                        with
                        productivity, stability, and independence. The secondary colour, orange, is associated with
                        enthusiasm,
                        friendliness, and warmth. As for the logo, I am currently using a placeholder logo which will be
                        updated
                        further in the process by the company’s graphic design team.

                This project is very special for me because I had the opportunity to take this project from start to
                finish and be completely involved in the whole process. I learnt a lot from this project, and it has
                definitely made me more aware of the importance of user research and how it can help in the design
                process of the whole app. The research helped me put myself in the users’ shoes even more and gain a
                greater understanding of the whole process. The process of designing the app has helped me realise how
                important accessibility is if we, as designers, really want to empower more users to use our products
                and gain something from them. I am hopeful that this is a topic that will be more and more present in
                everyday design and that we as a society will strive to be more inclusive towards every single
                individual. </p>
