            <p>Brainster is a tech-ed company on a mission to help young people future-proof their careers by learning
                Data-Science, UX/UI Design, Graphic Design, Coding, Digital Marketing & Software Testing. The company
                collaborates with learning partners that help students expand their knowledge through real projects.
                These learning partners communicate with Brainster’s career centre when they need candidates suitable
                for a position in their company.
                <br>
                <br>
                The <strong>main problem </strong>that the Brainster team is facing when selecting candidates that will
                be recommended to
                the the learning partners is the manual work that needs to be put in in order to find alumni through the
                company's growing database of alumni.

                <p>
                    The <strong>main goal </strong> for this project is to simplify the whole process of finding
                    suitable
                    candidates, and create a site where learning partners can specify what kind of people they need for
                    a
                    certain position without having to schedule meetings beforehand. The concept of the site was to
                    include
                    some of Brainster’s alumni on the website in order to give the learning partners a general idea of
                    the
                    students and their qualities. The idea is for the learning partners to take a look at some of the
                    candidates and then schedule a meeting with the Brainster team in order to get recommendations that
                    will
                    be tailored to the company’s needs.

                    This project was a team effort between me and four other UX/UI designers. We held various meetings
                    in
                    which we discussed what the website should look like and what features it should have. When making
                    the
                    wireframes, we decided to do a list of candidates, instead of cards in order to make the site look
                    more
                    simple and cleaner. When someone clicks on a certain candidate, a new pop-up window with information
                    about the candidate and skills he/she has appears.</p>

                <p class="forms">
                    There are also two forms that learning partners can fill in: the first form, “Hire a student” is
                    used
                    when the partners know exactly what they are looking for, while the second form, “Ask for help” is
                    made
                    for partners who want to schedule a meeting with someone from the Brainster team and consult on what
                    kind of a student they are looking for. </p>

            <p class="outcome">
                The learning outcomes of this project for me were mostly based around collaboration and teamwork. I had
                the opportunity to collaborate with fellow UX/UI designers and open my horizons to fresh perspectives
                and constructive feedback from people that are in the same field as I am. The team also had a lot of
                meetings with the client, which helped us get the bigger picture and provide the client with the best
                possible solution. And last but not least, I learnt how to collaborate with the development team and
                what the whole process after I finish my work as a designer looks like. </p>
